Some of my Python work

Hi. Not really sure where to begin here. Should I talk about myself or should I talk about my code? I think I'll just stick to the latter for now. 

Here are various Python projects that I've made for fun. 

If you're reading this I appreciate you. Please feel free to provide some feedback if you'd like.

Providing feedback is a skill in and of itself. It's a win win.

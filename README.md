Some of my Python work

Hi. Not really sure where to begin here. Should I talk about myself or should I just talk about my code? I think I'll just stick to the latter for now. 

Here are various Python projects that I've worked on just for fun. 

If you're reading this I appreciate you and ask that you stay tuned to observe my progress.

PLEASE provide some feedback if you feel the need to. I love feedback. It's a win win.
